      <description>Convolutional Neural Networks: Application Welcome to Course 4&amp;rsquo;s second assignment! In this notebook, you will:
 Implement helper functions that you will use when implementing a TensorFlow model Implement a fully functioning ConvNet using TensorFlow  After this assignment you will be able to:
 Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a classification problem  We assume here that you are already familiar with TensorFlow. If you are not, please refer the TensorFlow Tutorial of the third week of Course 2 (&amp;rdquo;Improving deep neural networks&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>Convolutional Neural Networks: Step by Step Welcome to Course 4&amp;rsquo;s first assignment! In this assignment, you will implement convolutional (CONV) and pooling (POOL) layers in numpy, including both forward propagation and (optionally) backward propagation.
Notation: - Superscript $[l]$ denotes an object of the $l^{th}$ layer. - Example: $a^{[4]}$ is the $4^{th}$ layer activation. $W^{[5]}$ and $b^{[5]}$ are the $5^{th}$ layer parameters.
 Superscript $(i)$ denotes an object from the $i^{th}$ example.</description>
